# PipeNetwork Runtime Directory

This directory contains your running Pipe Network node with all operational files separated from the repository code.

## Directory Structure

- `bin/` - Executable binaries
- `config/` - Configuration files (including your wallet and settings)
- `cache/` - Cache data generated by the node
- `logs/` - Log files
- `tools/` - Management tools like the `pop` command
- `scripts/` - Installation and management scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation files

## Why Separate Runtime and Repository?

Separating your running node from the source code repository provides several benefits:

1. **Prevents accidental commits of sensitive data**
2. **Keeps the repository clean** for development and sharing
3. **Avoids confusion** between operational files and code
4. **Simplifies backups** of just the runtime environment
5. **Makes it easier to update** without affecting your running node

## Managing Updates

When new versions of the toolkit are released:

1. Update your repo: `git pull`
2. Sync changes to runtime: `~/Workspace/pipe-pop/scripts/dev_workflow.sh` (Option 1)

## Making Improvements

If you improve the scripts or tools in this runtime directory:

1. Test your changes thoroughly
2. Sync changes back to repo: `~/Workspace/pipe-pop/scripts/dev_workflow.sh` (Option 2)
3. Review, commit, and consider submitting a pull request
