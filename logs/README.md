# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the Pipe Network node.

**Note**: Actual log files are excluded from Git and should not be committed to the repository.

## Log Files

When running the Pipe Network node, the following log files will be created in this directory:

- `pipe-pop.log` - Main log file with operational information
- `pipe-pop-error.log` - Error log file (if errors occur)
- `pipe-pop-metrics.log` - Performance metrics log

## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated to prevent them from growing too large. By default, logs are rotated daily and kept for 7 days.

You can configure log rotation settings in the configuration file:

```json
{
  "backup": {
    "enabled": true,
    "schedule": "daily",
    "retention_days": 7,
    "include_logs": true
  }
}
```

## Viewing Logs

To view the latest logs, you can use the following command:

```bash
pop logs view
```

Or directly:

```bash
tail -f logs/pipe-pop.log
```
