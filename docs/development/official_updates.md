# Handling Official Pipe Network Updates

> **IMPORTANT**: This is a community-created document for managing updates from the official Pipe Network project.

This guide explains how to incorporate updates from the official Pipe Network project into our community-enhanced toolkit while maintaining clear separation and avoiding conflicts.

## Monitoring for Official Updates

1. Regularly check the official Pipe Network sources for updates:
   - Official website
   - Official documentation
   - Release announcements

2. Document new versions and their changes in our version compatibility tracking.

## Update Process

When a new official update is released, follow these steps:

### 1. Documentation Updates

1. Update `docs/official/PIPE_NETWORK_DOCUMENTATION.md` with the latest official documentation.
2. Add a comment at the top indicating the version and date of the update.
3. Record changes in `CHANGELOG.md` with clear attribution to the official source.

### 2. Binary and Executable Updates

1. Test the new official binaries in an isolated environment.
2. Update our scripts to work with the new binaries if needed.
3. Document any changes to the setup process in the community guides.

### 3. Configuration Updates

1. Update configuration templates if the official software requires new fields.
2. Keep community-specific enhancements clearly separated in configuration files.
3. Document backward compatibility notes if applicable.

### 4. Version Compatibility

After testing and integration, update the version compatibility information in:
- `COMMUNITY_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
- `README.md`

## Avoiding Conflicts

To ensure our community enhancements don't conflict with official updates:

1. Keep all community scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
2. Use namespace prefixes for community-specific functions.
3. Maintain clear separation between official functionality and community enhancements.
4. Document any potential integration points or conflicts.

## Communication

When significant official updates occur:

1. Create a new release of our community toolkit that incorporates the official updates.
2. Clearly document what changed in both the official software and our community enhancements.
3. Provide migration guides if needed.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a useful community toolkit that complements the official Pipe Network software while respecting the boundaries between official and community work.
