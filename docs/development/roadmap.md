## Multi-Node Fleet Management System

We are prioritizing the development of a comprehensive fleet management system for Pipe Network nodes. This system will enable users to efficiently manage multiple nodes from a central interface.

### Architecture Overview

The system will use an SSH-based polling architecture with the following components:

1. **Central Management Server**
   - Main controller interface for multi-node management
   - Database for node data and metrics storage
   - Web/CLI dashboard for fleet visualization
   - Scheduler for timed operations

2. **Secure Connection Layer**
   - Restricted SSH key management
   - Connection pooling and optimization
   - Failure handling and automatic retries
   - Connection health monitoring

3. **Command Execution Framework**
   - Standardized command interface across nodes
   - Batch command execution capabilities
   - Output parsing and standardization
   - Error handling and reporting

4. **Data Collection and Analysis**
   - Time-series metrics storage
   - Historical performance analysis
   - Trend visualization and reporting
   - Alert generation based on thresholds

### Development Timeline

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Create directory structure for fleet management
- [ ] Develop SSH key management utilities
- [ ] Implement node registration system
- [ ] Build basic database schema and storage
- [ ] Create basic polling functionality

#### Phase 2: Monitoring Enhancement (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Develop metrics collection and aggregation
- [ ] Create multi-node dashboard visualization
- [ ] Implement basic alerting system
- [ ] Build historical data storage and retrieval
- [ ] Add node comparison functionality

#### Phase 3: Command Framework (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Build unified command execution system
- [ ] Implement batch operations across nodes
- [ ] Create command templates for common tasks
- [ ] Add scheduled task capabilities
- [ ] Develop command history and auditing

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-16)
- [ ] Implement configuration management
- [ ] Create update deployment system
- [ ] Add performance optimization utilities
- [ ] Develop node categorization and grouping
- [ ] Build external API for third-party integration

### Implementation Structure

The multi-node management system will be organized under the following directory structure:

```
src/
  fleet/
    core/
      ssh.sh
      registration.sh
      discovery.sh
    monitoring/
      collector.sh
      dashboard.sh
      alerts.sh
    operations/
      commands.sh
      batch.sh
      scheduler.sh
    admin/
      config.sh
      updates.sh
    db/
      metrics.sh
      nodes.sh
```

### Benefits

This system will provide:
- Centralized management of node fleets
- Simplified administration of multiple nodes
- Consistent configuration across installations
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Efficient command execution across your infrastructure
- Historical performance analysis and trending

## Integration with Official Pipe Network

As the official Pipe Network project evolves, we plan to:

1. Maintain compatibility with official releases
2. Provide seamless upgrades for community enhancements
3. Contribute selected improvements back to the official project where appropriate
4. Adapt to changes in the reward structure and network requirements

## Community Contribution Opportunities

We welcome community contributions in these areas:

- Performance optimization scripts
- Additional monitoring tools
- Documentation improvements
- Cross-platform testing and support
- Security auditing and hardening
- Multi-node management features and improvements

To contribute, please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
