2. Provide seamless upgrades for community enhancements
3. Contribute selected improvements back to the official project where appropriate
4. Adapt to changes in the reward structure and network requirements

## Community Contribution Opportunities

We welcome community contributions in these areas:

- Performance optimization scripts
- Additional monitoring tools
- Documentation improvements
- Cross-platform testing and support
- Security auditing and hardening

To contribute, please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
