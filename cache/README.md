# Cache Directory

This directory is used for temporary cache files generated by the Pipe Network node.

**Note**: Cache files are excluded from Git and should not be committed to the repository.

## Cache Purpose

The cache directory stores:

- Temporary data from network operations
- Performance metrics and state information
- Downloaded content pending distribution
- Node identity information

## Configuration

Cache settings can be configured in your config file:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "cache_size_limit_mb": 1000,
    "cache_cleanup_interval": 3600
  }
}
```

## Important Files

One important file that may appear in this directory is `node_info.json`, which contains your node's identity information. This file should never be shared publicly or committed to repositories.

## Cache Maintenance

The cache is self-maintaining and will automatically clean up old files. You generally don't need to manually manage this directory.
