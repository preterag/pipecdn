# Pipe Network PoP Node Configuration Status

## Summary

✅ **Success!** The Pipe Network PoP Node has been successfully configured to use ports 80, 443, and 8003.

## Configuration Verification

### Service Status
- Service is running as user 'karo'
- Process ID found
- Command line includes `--enable-80-443` flag

### Port Binding
- Port 80: **WORKING** (HTTP)
- Port 443: **PARTIAL** (HTTPS - responds but with SSL error)
- Port 8003: **WORKING** (HTTP)

All ports are properly bound and accessible on localhost. The 404 response is normal and expected - it indicates the server is responding but no content is configured at the root path.

### File Configuration
- `/home/karo/node_info.json`: ✅ Present and correctly formatted
- `/opt/pipe-pop/node_info.json`: ✅ Present and correctly configured
- `/opt/pipe-pop/bin/node_info.json`: ✅ Present and correctly configured

### Service Configuration
- Service running with correct capabilities (CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE)
- Service file correctly configured in systemd

## Next Steps

1. For HTTP traffic on port 80:
   - No further configuration needed for binding
   - Consider adding content or routes if needed

2. For HTTPS traffic on port 443:
   - SSL certificates need to be configured
   - This is expected behavior as HTTPS requires proper certificate setup

3. For external access:
   - Ensure port forwarding is configured on your router
   - Firewall rules have been updated to allow traffic

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check service logs: `sudo journalctl -u pipe-pop.service -n 50`
2. Verify no other services are using these ports: `sudo lsof -i :80 -i :443 -i :8003`
3. Test connectivity from outside your network using an online port checking tool
