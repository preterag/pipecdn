# Pipe Network Binaries

This directory contains the Pipe Network binary files. 

> **IMPORTANT**: The actual binaries should be obtained from the official Pipe Network sources.
> Our community enhancements are designed to work alongside the official binaries, not replace them.

## Official Binaries

The official Pipe Network binaries should be placed in this directory. The community enhancements expect the official binaries to be located here.

## How This Works

The community enhancements use this directory as follows:

1. During installation, the official Pipe Network binary should be downloaded to this directory
2. The system service will be configured to run the binary from this location
3. The community enhancement scripts will interact with the binary here

## Obtaining Official Binaries

Please refer to the official Pipe Network documentation for instructions on obtaining the official binaries.
