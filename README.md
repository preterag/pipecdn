## Quick Start

The easiest way to set up a Pipe PoP node is to use our one-command setup script:

```bash
# Download and run the setup script
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/preterag/pipecdn/master/easy_setup.sh -o easy_setup.sh
chmod +x easy_setup.sh
sudo ./easy_setup.sh
```

This script will:
1. Install all necessary dependencies
2. Set up your Solana wallet (or use your existing one)
3. Download and configure the Pipe PoP binary
4. Set up a systemd service for reliable operation
5. Configure automatic backups
6. Apply the Surrealine referral code (optional)
7. **Install the global `pop` command for easy management from anywhere**

After installation, you can immediately use the global `pop` command from anywhere on your system:

```bash
# Check your node status
pop --status

# View available commands
pop --help
```

## Manual Setup Instructions

If you prefer to set up your node manually, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/preterag/pipecdn.git
   cd pipecdn
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

4. Install the global `pop` command:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install_global_pop.sh
   ```

## About Pipe Network

The Pipe Network is a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) with several key features:

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Distributed network of nodes for content delivery
- **Hyperlocal Focus**: Content delivered from the closest geographical point
- **Blockchain-Powered**: Built on Solana for transparent operations
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower costs compared to traditional CDNs
- **Equitable Access**: Fair compensation for node operators
- **Flexible Payment Structure**: Pay-as-you-go model
- **Enhanced Security**: Distributed architecture reduces single points of failure

## Port Configuration

The Pipe PoP node requires the following ports to be open:

- **Port 80**: HTTP traffic
- **Port 443**: HTTPS traffic
- **Port 8003**: Pipe PoP node communication

These ports are automatically configured during installation, but you may need to ensure they are properly forwarded in your router if you want your node to be accessible from the internet. The node may not actively listen on all ports until it receives traffic, which is normal behavior.

## About Surrealine

[Surrealine](https://www.surrealine.com) is a streaming platform that utilizes the Pipe Network for content delivery. By using our referral code during setup, you support the Surrealine platform.

## Managing Your Node

After setting up your Pipe PoP node, you can manage it using the global `pop` command from anywhere on your system:

```bash
# Check node status
pop --status

# Monitor node performance
pop --monitor

# Create a backup
pop --backup

# Check for updates
pop --check-update

# Update to the latest version (requires sudo)
sudo pop --update

# View service logs
pop --logs

# Restart the service (requires sudo)
sudo pop --restart

# Generate a referral code
pop --gen-referral-route

# Check points and rewards
pop --points-route
```

## System Requirements

- **Minimum**: 2GB RAM, 20GB free disk space, stable internet connection
- **Recommended**: 4GB+ RAM, 100GB+ free disk space, 100Mbps+ internet connection
- **Required Ports**: 80, 443, and 8003 must be open and accessible

## Key Features of Pipe Network

- **Hyperlocal Content Delivery**: Content delivered from geographically close nodes
- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Solana for transparent operations
- **Economic Model**: Fair compensation for node operators
- **Permissionless Participation**: Anyone can run a node
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower costs compared to traditional CDNs
- **Advanced Security**: Distributed architecture reduces single points of failure
- **Reputation System**: Rewards reliable nodes
- **Referral System**: Earn rewards for referring new nodes
- **Automatic Updates**: Easy to keep your node up-to-date
- **Geographic Distribution**: Global network of nodes

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. **Backup**: Regularly backup your node_info.json file with `pop --backup`
2. **Monitor**: Check your node status with `pop --status`
3. **Update**: Keep your Pipe PoP binary updated with `sudo pop --update`

## Important Notes

- Ports 80, 443, and 8003 must be open and accessible
- A Solana wallet is required to receive rewards
- Sufficient disk space is needed for cache data
- Regular backups of node_info.json are essential

## Why Decentralized CDNs Matter

Traditional CDNs face challenges with centralization, high costs, and limited geographic coverage. Pipe Network addresses these challenges through its decentralized model, offering:

- Better geographic coverage through distributed nodes
- Lower costs through efficient resource utilization
- Fair compensation for infrastructure providers
- Enhanced security through decentralization
